### 🙇 What I'm upto lately

As a recent grad with 1–2 years of experience, I’ve become very aware of the gap between myself and the seasoned engineers teams rely on — and I’m actively working to close that gap. Gunning to become that 'software dude' at your company.

### 🏁 Competitive Programming

During my bachelor’s, I was deeply into competitive programming:  
- Participated in **ACM ICPC**, competed in **Google Kick Start**, took part in several other **global contests**  

It trained me to think clearly under pressure, reason about complexity, and handle edge cases.
